## Welcome to ElephantCopy

ElephantCopy is meant to be a simple utility for people who work with text all day. The intention is to create a keyboard focused UI that just lets you visually see what's on your clipboard, lets you copy something quickly and then gets out of your way. 

## Why another clipboard manager?

Lots of products exist today from open source to paid ones. However, I have found that privacy of the paid ones were not guaranteed as there were network calls to some data collection sites. The free ones lacked the visuals I wanted. So I decided to write my own. 

## I cannot see images and PDF files I copied

That is by design, ElephantCopy **ONLY works with (rich or plan) text**.

## Is it free?

You can use ElephantCopy in its free mode without any limitations. The only differnce will be added cards to your copy tray that remind you to buy the full version every now and then. The full price is a one time payment of $5. 

## What is next on the roadmap?

I will be adding the following features: 
- Customizable eyboard navigation
- Dark theme support
- Export of text to CSV
- Migration to SQLite
