## Welcome to ElephantCopy

ElephantCopy is meant to be a simple utility for people who work with text all day. The intention is to create a keyboard focused UI that just lets you visually see what's on your clipboard, lets you copy something quickly and then gets out of your way. 

## What does it look like?

### Settings

## Why another clipboard manager?

Lots of products exist today from open source to paid ones. However, I have found that privacy of the paid ones were not guaranteed as there were network calls to some data collection sites. The free ones lacked the visuals I wanted. So I decided to write my own.

## What is next on the roadmap?

I will be adding the following features: 
- Customize keyboard navigation shortcuts
- Enable dark theme support
