## Welcome to ElephantCopy

ElephantCopy is meant to be a simple utility for people who work with text all day. The intention is to create a keyboard focused UI that just lets you visually see what's on your clipboard, lets you copy something quickly and then gets out of your way. 

## Why another clipboard manager?

Lots of products exist today from open source to paid ones. However, I have found that privacy of the paid ones were not guaranteed as there were network calls to some data collection sites. The free ones lacked the visuals I wanted. So I decided to write my own. 

## I cannot see images and PDF files I copied

That is by design, ElephantCopy **ONLY works with (rich or plan) text**.

## How do I trust my password with you?

ElephantCopy does not copy your passwords. Most password managers (1Password etc.) do not use the general clipboard. Instead, they export to a special clipboard. ElephantCopy **only** reads from the **general** clipboard. As long as your password manager respects this convention, ElephantCopy will not get access to your passwords. Unless you manually copy something to the clipboard.

## What data is collected on me?

None. We do not collect any data whatsoever. The only data is collected by Apple to allow for the payment. 

## Is it free?

You can use ElephantCopy in its free mode without any limitations. The only differnce will be added cards to your copy tray that remind you to buy the full version every now and then. The full price is a one time payment of $5. 

## What is next on the roadmap?

I will be adding the following features: 
- Customize keyboard navigation shortcuts
- Enable dark theme support
- Migrate to SQLite
- Add ability to export of text to CSV
